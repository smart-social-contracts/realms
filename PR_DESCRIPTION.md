# Optimize Repetitive API Functions in Main Backend

## Summary

This PR consolidates 12+ nearly identical `get_*` functions in `main.py` into a single generic helper function, reducing code duplication by approximately 300 lines while maintaining 100% API compatibility.

## Problem

The `main.py` file contained 12+ functions (`get_users`, `get_mandates`, `get_tasks`, `get_transfers`, `get_instruments`, `get_codexes`, `get_organizations`, `get_disputes`, `get_licenses`, `get_realms`, `get_trades`, `get_proposals`, `get_votes`) that followed an identical pattern:

1. Call corresponding `list_*` function with pagination parameters
2. Extract items from result dictionary
3. Convert items to JSON using list comprehension
4. Create `PaginationInfo` object
5. Return `RealmResponse` with appropriate data structure

This repetition created maintenance overhead and increased the risk of inconsistencies.

## Solution

Created a generic `_generic_paginated_list()` helper function that:
- Accepts entity name, list function, pagination parameters, record class, and data key
- Handles all common logic (logging, pagination, JSON conversion, error handling)
- Maintains identical API contracts and response formats
- Preserves all existing error handling behavior

Each `get_*` function is now a simple one-liner that calls the generic helper with appropriate parameters.

## Changes Made

### Files Modified
- `src/realm_backend/main.py`: Consolidated repetitive functions
- `OPTIMIZATION_REPORT.md`: Comprehensive analysis of all optimization opportunities found

### Code Reduction
- **Before**: ~300 lines of repetitive code across 12+ functions
- **After**: ~25 lines for generic helper + 12 one-line function calls
- **Net Reduction**: ~275 lines of duplicated code

## API Compatibility

✅ **100% Backward Compatible**
- All function signatures remain identical
- Response formats are unchanged
- Error handling behavior preserved
- No breaking changes to existing clients

## Testing

- Verified all imports and dependencies remain correct
- Confirmed response structure matches original implementation exactly
- Checked error handling paths maintain same behavior
- Validated pagination logic works identically

## Additional Optimizations Identified

This PR includes a comprehensive optimization report (`OPTIMIZATION_REPORT.md`) documenting 6 categories of efficiency improvements found across the codebase:

1. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Code duplication in main API functions (✅ **FIXED IN THIS PR**)
2. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Code duplication in API layer (`ggg_entities.py`)
3. **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Inefficient list operations in demo loaders
4. **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Inefficient deduplication using `list(set())`
5. **LOW PRIORITY**: Repeated JSON serialization patterns
6. **LOW PRIORITY**: Large static data arrays

## Impact

- **Maintainability**: Significantly improved - single point of change for common patterns
- **Bug Risk**: Reduced - fewer places for inconsistencies to occur
- **Code Quality**: Enhanced through DRY principle application
- **Performance**: Minor improvements from reduced code size

## Future Work

The optimization report provides a roadmap for additional improvements that can be tackled in future PRs, prioritized by impact and complexity.
