"""Runtime test-mode flags — the single source of truth.

Test-mode flags live on the **Realm DB entity** (``Realm.load("1")``) and are set
at runtime via ``set_canister_config(test_flags_json=...)`` (see ``main.py``).
They are surfaced to the frontend through ``status()`` (``api/status.py``).

Historically some code read these flags from the build-time ``config.py`` module
(patched during the WASM build). That made the flags *baked in* — a reinstall or
environment change required a rebuild to flip them. This module replaces that with
a runtime read so a single ``set_canister_config`` call (e.g. from a Casals
arrangement) is enough, no rebuild required.

Importable from both the backend and from extensions/codices running inside the
realm canister (e.g. ``from core.runtime_flags import is_demo_data_active``).
