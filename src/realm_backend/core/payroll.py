"""Department payroll settlement (issue #260).

Settles salaries on-chain, one department at a time, as a chunked
``TaskManager`` job — a single IC update message cannot loop over thousands
of ICRC-1 transfers, so each tick processes a bounded batch and the task
disables its own schedule when nothing is left to pay.

Idempotency: one ``Transfer`` per (position, holder, period) with the
deterministic id ``SAL-<position key>-<principal>-<YYYY-MM>``. Re-running a
period skips seats whose transfer is already ``completed``, so neither a
double button press nor a crashed run can pay anyone twice. Failed transfers
are reset to pending when a new run is started, which is how retries work.

Two entry paths, one code path (mirrors ``core.position_admin``):

- **Direct** (governing policy 1/1): access_manager calls
  :func:`start_department_payroll` immediately.
- **Governed** (any other policy): access_manager submits an org-scoped
  Proposal whose inline code (:func:`build_payroll_proposal_code`) calls the
  same function after the vote passes.

Successful settlements record balanced double-entry ledger lines against the
department's fund (``personnel`` expense), which is what Financial Reports
and the access_manager Fund tab read.
