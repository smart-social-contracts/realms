"""Inter-canister calls for sandboxed extensions, by replay (issue #279).

The capability bridge in :mod:`core.extension_bridge` is synchronous, and it
cannot be made otherwise. ``_basilisk_sandbox.call_in_subinterpreter`` is a C
frame, ``sandbox_rpc`` is another, and an IC outcall only suspends at a *Python
generator's* ``yield`` — the point where ``async_result_handler`` (Rust) takes
over and ends the message. A generator frame is heap-allocated and can be
resumed; a native C frame cannot. So there is no way for sandboxed code to sit
and wait for an outcall: the stack it is standing on has to be gone before the
call can even be made.

What works instead is to let the extension *ask*, and run it again:

    round 0   host calls the entry point.  It requests an effect and returns.
    ...       host performs the outcall (a real ``yield``, message ends here).
    round 1   host calls the entry point again, with the result available.

``ggg_sdk``'s ``ctx.services.query()`` hides the seam. On the pass that has no
result it raises, and the dispatcher turns that into a request; on the pass that
has one it returns the value. So extension code stays straight-line:

    txns = ctx.services.query("registry.get_transactions", limit=20)

The cost is that the body re-runs from the top on every round, which is why
:data:`ASYNC_WRITE_RULE` exists: a function declared async may not write. A
write before the effect point would be applied once per round, and the sandbox
cannot be rolled back. Refusing writes outright is the only version of this that
is safe without a transaction, so async functions are reads and the writes go in
a separate sync call.

Two properties this deliberately does not give the extension:

* **No choice of target.** A verb that dials whatever principal it is handed
  would be a general-purpose outcall primitive — strictly more authority than
  the in-process access being removed, since it reaches every canister on the
  subnet. Each :class:`ServiceSpec` resolves its own target from host state.
* **No unbounded rounds.** ``MAX_ROUNDS`` caps how many times one call can make
  the host go out and come back, so an extension cannot spend the realm's
  cycles in a loop.
