"""Quarter auto-scaling policy (pure decision logic).

Decides *whether* a federation should spawn a new quarter when a new user is
created. The *how* (Casals provisioning) lives in the installer broker +
``main.py`` async trigger; this module is intentionally pure so the policy is
unit-testable without a replica.

Design (see issue #156):

* The federation codex may define ``should_deploy_quarter(populations, network,
  realm)`` to fully override the policy. It runs sandboxed over plain data
  (issue #265). When it does not, the built-in default applies.
* **Default rule:** scale when *every joinable* quarter has reached **90% of N**
  (i.e. there is no joinable quarter left with headroom). Using only the
  fullest quarter would keep minting forever after the first scale, because
  the old full quarter stays above the threshold.
* **N** = 2000 in production; **10** for the ``test`` / ``staging`` / ``demo``
  environments (so CI exercises sharding without 2000 joins).
* The actual deploy is **non-blocking**: the trigger only sets an idempotent
  "scale in flight" flag on the Realm; a separate async endpoint performs the
  Casals call and clears the flag.

Pure stdlib only (no ``_cdk``) so it imports under plain CPython in tests.
