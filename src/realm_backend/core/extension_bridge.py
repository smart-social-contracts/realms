"""Capability bridge for sandboxed extensions.

``core.codex_bridge`` gave codex *hooks* a way to reach the realm without host
imports. This is the same idea for extension *entry points*, and it is what
makes sandboxing a non-core extension possible at all: a subinterpreter has no
``ggg``/``core``/``basilisk``, so before this module the only sandboxable
extension was one that needed nothing from the realm.

The decisive difference from the codex bridge is **the caller**. An extension
entry point is invoked by an authenticated user, and the host injects that
identity into every verb:

    handler = make_rpc_handler(ext_id, capabilities, caller=ic.caller().to_str())

``caller`` is a closure variable. Sandboxed code cannot set it, override it, or
pass it as a kwarg — :func:`make_rpc_handler` refuses any request carrying an
identity-shaped argument. This is what retires the bug class fixed in phase 0,
where four extensions decided ownership by comparing against a ``user_id`` the
client supplied. Under this bridge an extension cannot *name* a user, so the
comparison it used to get wrong is not expressible.

Shape of the API, per the hybrid design:

**Reads are generic and gated.** ``entity.list`` / ``entity.get`` over a
registry of :class:`EntityPolicy`. Each policy fixes the exposed fields and how
rows are scoped to the caller, and the host applies that scope *before*
returning rows. This is the single place per-record read authorization is
enforced, and it retires the ``X.instances()`` full-scan the extensions do
today.

**Writes are typed.** A generic ``entity.update`` would let an extension write
any field — including reassigning ``user`` to hand itself someone else's row —
and gives nowhere to express invariants like "one territory zone per H3 cell,
realm-wide". So each write is a named verb that owns its field allowlist and
its invariants, host-side.

Unlike codex effects, extension writes execute live over ``rpc`` rather than as
a post-hoc batch. Codex hooks batch because a governance hook's mutations
should reach the host as one ordered, reviewable unit. An extension entry point
is request/response — it needs the id it just created in order to answer — and
the operation-level gate in ``core.extension_access`` has already run by the
time any verb is reachable. Each write is still individually authorized here.

Trust model, unchanged from the codex bridge: everything in this module is
host-side and is the only thing enforcing anything. The in-sandbox ``ggg_sdk``
``ctx`` facade is convenience and is assumed to be fully rewritable by a
hostile extension.

#
# It does not, because the extension never needed the class — it needed two
# separable things:
#
#   1. *Declaring* the schema. That is pure declarative metadata (field names,
#      types, lengths, the alias), so it moves out of ``entry.py`` and into the
#      manifest, where the host registers it at install time. No sandbox
#      involvement at all.
#
#   2. *CRUD over its own rows*. That is the verbs below.
#
# What makes this safe is namespacing. ``create_extension_entity_class`` stores
# under ``ext_<extension>::<Class>``, so an extension's own tables are already
# disjoint from every other extension's and from ``ggg``. Authorization is
# therefore structural: the host derives the namespace from the *calling
# extension id*, never from an argument, so generic CRUD here cannot reach
# another extension's data. That is precisely why generic writes are safe for
# extension-owned types while shared ``ggg`` types need typed verbs.
