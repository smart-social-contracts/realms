"""``treasury.*`` verbs (issue #269).

Epoch-based allocation of recognized revenue into department funds — the GGG
treasury standard from #261. The read model already lives in
:mod:`core.treasury_allocation`; the reads here are thin gated wrappers over it.

The writes are the interesting half. Every mutating treasury action is governed
by the org linked to the source fund (ROOT by default): a 1/1 policy applies
directly, anything else becomes an org-scoped proposal that replays the action on
approval. In-process, ``budget_manager`` made that whole decision itself — the
rights check, the direct-vs-vote split, and the construction of the proposal.

Two things about that are worth not reproducing across a sandbox boundary:

* **The action dict is replayed.** ``apply_treasury_action`` dispatches on it,
  and ``build_treasury_proposal_code`` embeds it in code that runs after a vote
  passes. A verb accepting an arbitrary dict would let the extension put anything
  in there, so :data:`ACTION_FIELDS` is a per-kind allowlist and the action is
  rebuilt here from scratch rather than forwarded.
* **``triggered_by`` is attribution.** It ends up in the audit trail and in the
  proposal description. It is set from the authenticated caller and an extension
  cannot supply it — ``RESERVED_KWARGS`` in the bridge already refuses
  identity-shaped arguments, and the rebuild means there is nowhere to hide one.

Disabling the automatic schedule is deliberately the one write that is always
direct for a manager: switching automation off is the safe direction, and making
it wait for a vote would mean money keeps moving while the vote runs.
