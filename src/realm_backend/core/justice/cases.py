"""Case lifecycle: filing, judges, verdicts, penalties, appeals.

The state changes themselves are :mod:`ggg.justice`'s (``case_file``,
``case_assign_judges``, ``case_issue_verdict``, ``case_transfer``,
``case_begin_executing``, ``case_close``, ``penalty_execute``,
``penalty_waive``, ``appeal_file``, ``appeal_decide``, ``appeal_withdraw``).
What is here is the part the extension used to do and should not have:
deciding *whose* name goes on each one, and refusing the combinations that
make the process meaningless.

Three of those refusals are new, and each closes a hole in the in-process version:

* **A case is filed by its plaintiff.** ``file_case`` accepted a ``plaintiff_id``,
  so anyone holding ``dispute.create`` could file a case in another member's name.
* **A verdict is issued by an assigned judge.** ``issue_verdict`` accepted a
  ``judge_id`` and never checked it against the case, so anyone holding
  ``resolution.issue`` could issue a ruling attributed to any judge in the realm,
  on a case that judge had never seen.
* **An appeal is filed by a party to the case.** ``file_appeal`` accepted an
  ``appellant_id``, so an appeal could be filed in a stranger's name.

Cross-quarter cases (``defendant_quarter_id`` in metadata) are recorded but not
executed against: reaching the defendant's home canister needs an inter-canister
call, which is :mod:`core.async_bridge` territory and not yet wired up here.
