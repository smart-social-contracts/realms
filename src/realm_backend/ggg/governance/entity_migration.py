"""EntityMigration — a forwarding stub left behind when a mobile entity moves.

When a mobile entity (a user, an organization) leaves this canister for
another quarter or realm, it leaves a small ``EntityMigration`` record here
pointing at where it went. Resolving a stale ``realm://`` reference then walks
the chain of these stubs hop-by-hop until it reaches the entity's current home.

Why a per-canister stub instead of a central locator (see issue #156):

* A global ``principal -> location`` index would be one row per entity
  (millions network-wide), which blows the ~few-thousand-entity ceiling of
  ``ic-python-db`` — the very limit quarters exist to respect.
* Each canister therefore stores forwarding stubs **only for entities that
  actually lived here**, bounded by its own population. The chain is
  distributed; no canister holds a global map.

Both ``prev_ref`` and ``next_ref`` are **full** ``realm://`` URIs, so a chain
can span quarters *and* realms transparently. Each stub is signed by the
subject's principal so a malicious canister cannot forge a redirect.

Only mobile entities get chains. Immutable records (Vote, Case, LedgerEntry)
never move and are referenced by plain absolute URIs with no forwarding.
