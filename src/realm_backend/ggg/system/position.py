"""Job positions and appointments within an organization (issue #241).

A ``Position`` is a *seat definition* on a Department: a titled role with a
capability profile, a headcount, and a salary line that feeds the org's
personnel budget planning. An ``Appointment`` is the *occupancy record* — who
holds a seat and for what period. Keeping the two apart gives vacancy math,
appointment history, and terms for free:

    vacancies = headcount - active appointments

Positions answer "what seat, in which org, at what cost" (org structure +
accounting); ``UserProfile`` answers "what can this person do" (authorization).
The two stay linked but distinct — a profile may be shared by positions in
several organizations.
