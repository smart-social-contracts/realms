class Notification(Entity, TimestampedMixin):
    """Notification (a.k.a. message) with visibility + audience semantics.

    Two orthogonal dimensions decide delivery:

      * ``visibility`` (``private`` | ``public``) — who may *read* it. Public
        notifications are readable by anyone; private ones only by their
        audience.
      * ``audience_type`` (``user`` | ``department`` | ``realm``) — who it is
        *addressed* to.

    Broadcasts (department / realm) are stored as a **single** record and the
    set of recipients is resolved at read time, rather than fanned out into one
    row per user. This keeps realm-wide and public messages cheap.

    Read state:
      * ``user`` notifications use the ``read`` boolean.
      * broadcasts track per-user read state in ``read_by`` (comma-separated
        principals), so one reader marking it read does not affect others.
