## What is Realms?

Realms is a decentralized software platform for public administration — a Governance Operating System (GOS) designed to deliver essential public services such as justice, social welfare, property registries, and more.

From small towns to entire nations, it empowers communities to design, run, and evolve their own governance systems — free from the corruption and inefficiencies of traditional bureaucracy.

## Key Features

- **Fully Auditable**: Every action is recorded on-chain
- **AI-Powered**: Intelligent automation for governance tasks
- **Extensible**: Build custom extensions for your specific needs
- **Transparent**: All governance rules are visible and verifiable
- **Efficient**: Eliminate bureaucratic overhead and corruption
