# Realms: Non-Technical Introduction

## What is Realms?

Realms is a platform for building **digital governance systems** on the Internet Computer blockchain. Think of it as an operating system for managing communities, organizations, or digital nations with complete transparency and automation.

## Why Use Realms?

Traditional governance systems struggle with:
- **Lack of transparency** in decision-making and fund management
- **Manual processes** that slow everything down
- **Limited participation** in governance decisions
- **Trust issues** around rule enforcement

Realms solves these by making everything transparent, automated, accessible, and trustworthy through blockchain technology.

## What Can You Build?

### Common Use Cases
- **Digital Communities** - Citizen management, voting, automated services
- **DAOs** - Decentralized organizations with transparent treasury and governance
- **Service Registries** - License issuance, payments, dispute resolution
- **Cooperative Platforms** - Member management, benefit distribution, democratic decision-making

## Core Concepts

**Citizens & Identity** - Users, organizations, roles, and permissions

**Treasury & Finance** - Manage funds, assets, transfers, and balances transparently

**Governance** - Proposals, voting, mandates, and automated rule execution

**Automation** - Scheduled tasks that execute rules without human intervention

## How It Works

1. **Deploy** - Launch your governance system on the blockchain
2. **Configure** - Set up rules (voting thresholds, tax rates, etc.)
3. **Populate** - Add members and organizations
4. **Automate** - Rules execute automatically on schedule
5. **Govern** - Members vote on proposals and participate

Everything is recorded on the blockchain, visible to all, and executed fairly by code.

## Key Benefits

**For Leaders** - Deploy in minutes, automate administration, build trust through transparency

**For Members** - Participate from anywhere, see all decisions, get fair treatment

**For Organizations** - Lower costs, faster operations, automatic compliance
