# Getting Started

Welcome to Realms GOS! This guide will help you get up and running quickly.

## What You'll Need

- **Python 3.8+** - For the Realms CLI
- **Node.js 18+** - For frontend development
- **dfx** - Internet Computer SDK ([install guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install/))

## Installation

### 1. Install the Realms CLI

```bash
pip install realms-gos
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
realms --version
```

### 2. Create Your First Realm

Create a new realm with demo data:

```bash
realms realm create --random --citizens 50 --organizations 10
```

This will:
- Generate a new realm with 50 citizens and 10 organizations
- Create all necessary configuration files
- Set up the project structure

### 3. Deploy Locally

Navigate to your realm directory and deploy:

```bash
cd generated_realm
./scripts/2-deploy-canisters.sh
```

### 4. Upload Data

Upload the demo data to your realm:

```bash
./scripts/3-upload-data.sh
```

### 5. Access Your Realm

Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://<canister_id>.localhost:8000
```

The canister ID will be displayed in your terminal after deployment.
