"""
Python implementation of the Generalized Global Governance (GGG) standard

This module re-exports from ggg.entities for backward compatibility.
For CLI usage, import directly from ggg.entities (no runtime dependencies).
For canister usage, import from ggg and use ggg.runtime to patch behavior.

Note: Call and TaskStep are implementation details for task execution,
not part of the core GGG standard.
