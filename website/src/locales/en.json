    "title": "What is Realms?",
    "description": "<strong>Realms</strong> is a decentralized software platform for public administration — a Governance Operating System (GOS) designed to deliver essential public services such as justice, social welfare, property registries, and more. From small towns to entire nations, it empowers communities to design, run, and evolve their own governance systems — free from the corruption and inefficiencies of traditional bureaucracy. This way, Realms opens a window towards a new civilizational paradigm called <strong>Smart Social Contracts</strong>.",
