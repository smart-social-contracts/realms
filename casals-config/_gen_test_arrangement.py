"""Generator for the realms test-environment arrangements:

  - arrangements/test.json       full fidelity: 3 realms, every manifest
                                 extension (~93 steps). Mirrors
                                 examples/demo/realm{1,2,3}/manifest.json.
  - arrangements/test-lite.json  fast iteration: 1 realm (Dominion), a
                                 handful of core extensions (~8 steps).

These are realms-owned Casals objects: the Casals engine lives in the `casals/`
submodule, while this environment-specific config lives here in the realms repo.
Seed them with: casals/scripts/seed.py --config-dir casals-config --arrangement <name> --arrangement-only

Re-run if the manifests change. The JSON files are the committed artifacts."""
