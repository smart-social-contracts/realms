## Create a new realm

Write a JSON file or copy one from the [Realm Registry](https://registry.realmsgos.org).


```bash
realms realm import cli/example_realm_data.json
```
Upload members, codex, ...

or from the `Administration Dashboard`.

Decent amount of members (10k) and other objects simulating a production-like environment.
Runs scheduled tasks for payments, tax claculations etc.
Voting of new codex and deployment of it.
Registry in the [Realm Registry](https://registry.realmsgos.org).
