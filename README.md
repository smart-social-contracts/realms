Realms is a decentralized platform that allows the deployment of public administration services on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP).

Its purpose is to transform the way humanity manages the planet's resources and the population by creating a market of realms.

Minimizing to zero the time and resources needed to create a public infrastructure from scratch
Create a free market of realms,
stanadrization that enables interoperability and reusability of working intrastructure. For that, the Generalized Global Governance (GGG) framework is creatd

The framework is specially intended for Aritifcial Inteligence to operate with the realm.

## Generalized Global Governance (GGG)

GGG is a framework that provides a standardized approach to implementing decentralized governance systems. Here are the key components:

### Core Concepts

- **Realm**: A sovereign space where organizations can operate
- **World**: The top-level container for all realms
- **Organization**: A governed entity with its own tokens and rules
- **ExtensionCode**: Custom logic for governance and operations
- **Resource**: Managed assets (e.g., land, compute resources)
- **Proposal**: Formal suggestions for changes
- **Vote**: Decision-making mechanism
- **User**: Individual participants
- **Wallet**: Multi-token storage for assets

### Organization Structure

```
Organization
├── Wallet
│   ├── Governance Token
│   ├── Resource Tokens
│   └── Treasury (ICP, external tokens)
├── Proposals
│   └── Votes
└── ExtensionCode
    └── Custom Logic
```

### Permissions

Access control is managed through a permission system:
- User-level permissions
- Organization-level permissions
- Resource-specific permissions

## Inter-realm Communication

- Organizations can communicate across realms
- Proposals can be sent to top-level organizations
- Seamless user migration between realms
- Cross-realm token transfers
